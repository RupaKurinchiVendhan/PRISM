    "# Downstream Evaluation: Species Classification with SpeciesNet\n",
    "\n",
    "Wildlife species classification from camera trap images represents a crucial downstream task for evaluating image restoration models in ecological applications. This task serves as an excellent testbed for restoration quality assessment because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ecological Impact**: Accurate species classification directly supports biodiversity monitoring, conservation efforts, and wildlife research\n",
    "2. **Challenging Conditions**: Camera trap images often suffer from motion blur, low light, weather artifacts, and partial occlusions, making restoration particularly valuable\n",
    "3. **Fine-grained Recognition**: Distinguishing between closely related species requires preservation of subtle visual features that could be lost during restoration\n",
    "4. **Real-world Variability**: Images span diverse environments, lighting conditions, and animal poses, providing comprehensive restoration evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation framework uses Google's SpeciesNet ensemble, combining MegaDetector for animal detection with a specialized species classifier, to assess how well restored camera trap images maintain the critical visual information needed for accurate wildlife identification."

    "## Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "This section implements a sophisticated evaluation framework specifically designed for wildlife species classification. The metrics account for the hierarchical nature of taxonomic classification and the unique challenges of camera trap image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Species-Level Classification Metrics:**\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Overall fraction of correctly identified species\n",
    "- **Precision (Weighted)**: Average precision across species, weighted by species frequency in the dataset\n",
    "- **Recall (Weighted)**: Average recall across species, weighted by species frequency\n",
    "- **F1-Score (Weighted)**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, accounting for class imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical Taxonomic Accuracy:**\n",
    "- **Multi-level Accuracy**: Evaluates correctness at different taxonomic levels (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species)\n",
    "- **Taxonomic Distance**: Measures how \"close\" incorrect predictions are to the true species in taxonomic hierarchy\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Precision**: Considers predictions correct if they match at any taxonomic level above species\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidence and Reliability Metrics:**\n",
    "- **Prediction Confidence Analysis**: Distribution of model confidence scores and their calibration\n",
    "- **Confidence-Accuracy Correlation**: Relationship between prediction confidence and actual accuracy\n",
    "- **Failure Mode Analysis**: Categorization and frequency of different types of prediction failures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Evaluation Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Imbalance Handling:**\n",
    "Wildlife datasets typically exhibit severe class imbalance, with some species having thousands of examples while others have only a few. The evaluation framework uses weighted metrics to account for this imbalance and provides per-class performance analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Taxonomic Hierarchy Awareness:**\n",
    "Unlike generic image classification, species identification benefits from taxonomic knowledge. A prediction of \"Gray Wolf\" when the true species is \"Red Wolf\" is more acceptable than predicting \"House Cat\" - both are taxonomically closer and ecologically more reasonable errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geographic and Temporal Context:**\n",
    "The framework can incorporate geographic priors and temporal information when available, providing more nuanced evaluation that reflects real-world deployment scenarios where species distributions and seasonal patterns matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Pattern Analysis:**\n",
    "Systematic analysis of common misclassification patterns helps identify whether errors are due to visual similarity, taxonomic confusion, or systematic biases in the model or dataset."
