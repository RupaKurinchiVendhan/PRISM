# Weather and Cloud Distortion Augmentation Tools

This guide documents how to use third-party open-source scripts to apply synthetic **rain**, **snow**, and **cloud cover** to images, primarily for training and evaluating models on degraded input scenarios.

## Setup

### Clone the Repositories

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hgupta01/Weather_Effect_Generator.git
git clone https://github.com/strath-ai/SatelliteCloudGenerator.git
````

### Install Dependencies

Each repository contains a `requirements.txt` file or environment setup instructions. Install dependencies (ideally in a virtual environment) using:

```bash
cd Weather_Effect_Generator
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd ../SatelliteCloudGenerator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ’§ Applying Rain and Snow

The `Weather_Effect_Generator` provides standalone scripts for generating rain and snow overlays for images. You can batch-process an entire folder by adapting these scripts. Control parameters such as intensity and particle size by editing script arguments or config files.

---

## Adding Synthetic Cloud Cover

The `SatelliteCloudGenerator` generates cloud masks and image overlays. Masks are sampled and warped before being overlaid. Parameters such as cloud coverage, brightness, and randomness can be tuned via command-line flags.

---

## Output Format

Both scripts overwrite or save new images in your specified output directory. Ensure:

* You preserve original image structure or filenames for consistency.
* You optionally store metadata about the applied transformation for later use.

---

## Integration Notes

* These augmentations are useful for generating training or evaluation data for models like PRISM.
* For PRISM, append a label or prompt (e.g., `"remove clouds"`, `"remove snow"`) describing the transformation applied to the image.
* These augmentations can be integrated into a larger pipeline for **composite degradation** by sequentially applying multiple distortions.
